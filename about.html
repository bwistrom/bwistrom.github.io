                    Design is something I find ridiciously funny and hours can pass, just by playing with different
                    configurations. That is actually a good thing because practice makes perfect !

                <span class="highlight">
                    Studying Backend Web Development was clearly the right choice.. not just because my Initials is B W,
                    but it's something that makes me want more of it.
                    At the moment I am in the beginning of my education but I feel like it is not just about to attend
                    school,
                    It is going to be a lifestyle of mine.
                    I know I have choosen the right field and the motivation is just increasing. I will take a note of
                    this
                    VISION and get back to it further on as I develop my
                    skills within this field.
